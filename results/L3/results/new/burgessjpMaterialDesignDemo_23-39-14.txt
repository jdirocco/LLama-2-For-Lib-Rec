    [/INST]</s> # Maven Dependencies

Here are the recommended Maven dependencies for the "burgessjp/MaterialDesignDemo" project:

1. com.android.support:cardview-v7:28.0.0
2. com.github.amlcurran.showcase:showcase:1.0.1
3. com.android.support:recyclerview-vaadin:28.0.0
4. de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:2.2.0
5. com.android.support:transition:28.0.0

Each of these dependencies can be added to the project's Maven build file (pom.xml) using the following format:

<dependency>
    <groupId>groupId</groupId>
    <artifactId>artifactId</artifactId>
