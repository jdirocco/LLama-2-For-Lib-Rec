    [/INST]</s>
     Based on the project descriptions, here are five recommendations for libraries that could enhance the capabilities of the brix-cms project:

1. org.brixcms:brix-workspace - This library is already a part of the project's dependencies, but I would recommend including it in the list of recommendations as it provides a foundation for building custom CMS applications with Brix.

2. org.modeshape:modeshape-jcr - This library provides a JCR (Java Content Repository) implementation that can be used to store and manage content in a Brix-based CMS. It can help improve the project's content management capabilities and provide a more robust storage solution.

3. com.google.code.wicket-spring:wicket-spring - This library provides a set of Wicket components that can be used to integrate Wicket with Spring. It can help simplify the development process and provide more seamless integration between the CMS and other parts of the application.

4. org.easymock:easymock - This library provides a simple and efficient way to create mock objects for testing. It can help improve the project's testing capabilities and make it easier to write and run tests.

5. commons-io:commons-io - This library provides a set of utilities for working with files and other resources. It can help improve the project's file handling capabilities and provide more robust and reliable file I/O operations.

Overall, these libraries can help improve the project's content management capabilities, provide more seamless integration with other parts of the application, simplify the development process, and provide more robust file I/O operations.
    Please ignore any code snippets or examples and focus solely on extracting the Maven dependencies from the text.
    Please format the response as a list of Maven dependencies, each on a new line.

    Recommendations must be in the Maven format and focus on enhancing the project's capabilities or addressing any identified needs. Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format. Reccomend me 5 libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities.
    [/INST]</s> # Maven Dependencies

Here are five libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities:

1. org.springframework:spring-web:5.3.10 - This library provides a comprehensive set of web frameworks and tools for building web applications. It can help simplify the development process and provide more robust web functionality.

2. org.hibernate:hibernate-core:5.4.32 - This library provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It can help improve the project's data management capabilities and provide more robust database integration.

3. org.apache.wicket:wicket:8.0.0 - This library provides a set of components and tools for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It can help simplify the development process and provide more robust web functionality.

4. org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.32 - This library provides a simple and flexible logging API that can be used to log messages and exceptions in the application. It can help improve the project's logging capabilities and provide more robust error handling.

5. com.google.guava:guava:31.0.1-jre - This library provides a set of utilities and data structures that can be used to improve the project's overall functionality and performance. It can help simplify the development process and provide more robust and efficient code.
