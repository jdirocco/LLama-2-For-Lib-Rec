    Project Name: sebastiangraf/jSCSI
    Project Description: jSCSI - A Java iSCSI implementation in Java only. For further documentation, please refer to https://travis-ci.org/sebastiangraf/jscSI.
    Existing Dependencies:
    org.jscsi:commons
- org.jscsi:initiator
- org.testng:testng
- org.apache.jclouds.api:filesystem
- org.slf4j:slf4j-api
- org.jscsi:target
- ch.qos.logback:logback-core
    Focus on suggesting libraries that enhance the project's capabilities, improve performance, or introduce new functionalities relevant to the project's needs. Provide a brief explanation for each recommended library, highlighting how it benefits the project. Reccomend me 5 libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities.
    [/INST]</s>
     As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, I would suggest the following five libraries to enhance the capabilities of the project "sebastiangraf/jSCSI":

1. com.google.guava:guava:28.1-jre-releases: Guava is a Java library that provides a set of utility classes for tasks such as caching, concurrency, and string manipulation. It can help improve the performance of jSCSI by providing more efficient algorithms for certain tasks.

2. org.jscsi:jscsi-target-utils:1.0.0: This library provides additional target utilities for jSCSI, which can help improve the performance and functionality of the iSCSI implementation. It can be useful for tasks such as target discovery and connection management.

3. ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.3: Logback is a Java logging framework that can help improve the logging capabilities of jSCSI. It provides a more powerful and flexible logging system than the existing slf4j-api library, which can help developers debug and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

4. com.google.code.findbugs:jsc-annotations:2.0.1: This library provides annotations for jSCSI that can help improve the quality of the code by detecting potential bugs and issues. It can help developers write more robust and maintainable code.

5. org.apache.jclouds.blob:blob-client:2.2.0: This library provides a Java client for interacting with cloud storage providers such as Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage. It can help jSCSI expand its support for cloud storage and provide more flexible storage options for users.

In conclusion, these five libraries can help enhance the capabilities and performance of the jSCSI project by providing more efficient algorithms, better logging capabilities, improved code quality, and additional storage options. They are well-maintained and widely used in the Java community, making them suitable for integration with jSCSI.
    Please ignore any code snippets or examples and focus solely on extracting the Maven dependencies from the text.
    Please format the response as a list of Maven dependencies, each on a new line.
