Provide a brief explanation for each recommended library, highlighting how it benefits the project. Reccomend me 5 libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities.
    [/INST]</s>
     As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, I would suggest the following five libraries to enhance the capabilities of the cglib/cglib project:

1. com.google.code.findbugs:findbugs - This library provides a comprehensive set of tools for detecting and diagnosing bugs in Java code. By integrating this library, the project can benefit from improved code quality and stability.
2. org.ow2.asm:asm - This library provides an API for manipulating Java bytecode. By leveraging this library, the project can gain more control over the generated proxy objects and improve the performance of the dynamic proxies.
3. net.sourceforge.jtidy:jtidy - This library provides a powerful HTML and XML tidy tool for Java. By incorporating this library, the project can ensure that the generated code adheres to the highest standards of code formatting and readability.
4. org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12 - This library provides a flexible and lightweight API for logging in Java applications. By integrating this library, the project can improve the logging mechanism and provide more detailed and informative logs.
5. com.github.rholder:spoon - This library provides a simple and intuitive API for creating and manipulating Java objects. By leveraging this library, the project can simplify the process of generating and transforming Java bytecode.

In summary, these libraries can enhance the capabilities of the cglib/cglib project by improving code quality, performance, and readability. By integrating these libraries, the project can benefit from more comprehensive and effective tools for generating and transforming Java bytecode.
    Please ignore any code snippets or examples and focus solely on extracting the Maven dependencies from the text.
    Please format the response as a list of Maven dependencies, each on a new line.
