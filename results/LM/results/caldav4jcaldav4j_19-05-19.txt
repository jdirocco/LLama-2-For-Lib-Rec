    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Project Name: caldav4j/caldav4j
    Project Description: CalDAV4j Overview\n\n| | |\n|||\n| Build Status | |\n| Maven | |\n| License | |\n\n\n\n\n\nCalDAV4j is a java library implementing the CalDAV protocol for the client side implementation.\n\nCalDAV4j makes it easy to issue complex queries to a caldav server, supporting freebusy and calendarcollections. Moreover, it supports the standard adding and removal of events.\n\n CalDAV4j\n\n Goals\n\n HighLevel CalDAV API\'s: This API works at the level of iCal4j objects, and allows for high level operations. All the "hard" protocol work that you need to do to make this happen is hidden from the end user.\n\n Low Level API Access: Let\'s you work at the Http/WebDAV/CalDAV protocol level by creating instances of HttpMethods like GetMethod, MkCalendar, ReportMethod, etc. and executing them.\n\n Flexible query language support: An easy and flexible query language eg. for events in a given date range; and Recurring event management eg. updating master events and recurrence instances.\n\n Performance: When possible, caches such as caches of etags and icalendar resources are maintained so that network chatter and parsing of icalender files is minimized.\n\n Compliance: We aim to be compliant with the following specs:\n CalDAV spec and updates. , \n CalDAV Scheduling specs. Work in Progress, \n Reliability: Many functional tests and the "rails" for checking your caldav implementation support.\n\n Using CalDAV4j in your code\n\nCalDav4j is available currently on Maven Central, thus to add it, you can add a dependancy by adding the following to the :\n\n\n\nGradle:\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to add CalDAV4j into your code, please refer to: are two versions currently Stable based on HttpClient 3.x and Dev branch based on HttpClient 4.x depending on which version of HttpClient you want to use will determine the version to use.\n\n Documentation\n\nThe unit tests are currently best place right now to see how to use CalDAV4j. Documentation can be found on the \n\n Building\n\nCalDAV4j uses Maven as its build system. To build this project, one must simply install through maven, while skipping all the tests:\n\n\n\n Testing\n\nDuring package creation, you can test your caldav server replacing the with your own custom one.\n\n\n\nA Docker image of a caldav server, Bedework 900MB is distributed via Docker Hub:\n\n\n\nBefore committing, always reformat your code\n\n\n\n License\n\nCalDAV4j is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License\n Copyright \xc2\xa9 20052011 Open Source Application Foundation\n Copyright \xc2\xa9 2011 Present Individual Contributors\n\n Contributing Organizations and Individuals\n\n Organizations\n ParTec\n OSAFoundation No longer contributing\n Individuals\n Roberto Polli \n Ankush Mishra \n Mark Hobson \n Bobby Rullo\n \n\n Current Status\n\nCalDAV4j 0.9.2 is the current tagged release and 1.0.0rc.1 is the current development branch.\n\nFor the complete changelog, refer to this .\n'
