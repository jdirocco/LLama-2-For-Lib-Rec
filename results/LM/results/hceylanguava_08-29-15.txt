    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

APIs marked with the @Beta annotation at the class or method level\nare subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even\nremoved, at any time. If your code is a library itself i.e. it is\nused on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control, you should\nnot use beta APIs, unless you repackage them e.g. using ProGuard.\n\n2. Deprecated nonbeta APIs will be removed eighteen months after the\nrelease in which they are first deprecated. You must fix your\nreferences before this time. If you don\'t, any manner of breakage\ncould result you are not guaranteed a compilation error.\n\n3. Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change.

Our classes are not designed to protect against a malicious caller.\nYou should not use them for communication between trusted and\nuntrusted code.\n\n5. We unittest and benchmark the libraries using only OpenJDK 1.6 on\nLinux. Some features, especially in com.google.common.io, may not work\ncorrectly in other environments.\n\n'

    Focus on suggesting libraries that enhance the project's capabilities, improve performance, or introduce new functionalities relevant to the project's needs. Provide a brief explanation for each recommended library, highlighting how it benefits the project. Reccomend me 6 libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities.
