<s>[INST] <<SYS>> Given the recommendations for a Java project provided in the text below, please list these recommendations exclusively in the Maven format (groupId:artifactId:version). Ensure that the output consists solely of Maven dependencies, without additional explanations or content.
    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

This comes at a cost of also using a lot of processing power.\n\nThe following Organizations support Tycho getting processing power for their builds:\n host our CI Infrastructure, become a friend of Eclipse and support the Eclipse Foundation in general\n sponsors a resource pack with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM\n sponsors two resource packs with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM each\n sponsors a resource pack with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM\n sponsors a resource pack with 2 CPU / 8 GB RAM\n\n\nIf your Organizations is an you can help us by to speed up builds. Organizations can check how many Resource Packs they have left for project sponsoring on the .\n'
