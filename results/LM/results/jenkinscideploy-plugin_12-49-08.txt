    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Project Name: jenkinsci/deploy-plugin
    Project Description: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenkins Deploy Plugin\n=========================\n\nThis plugin permits Jenkins to Deploy into containers and application servers. It takes a war/ear file and deploys that to a running remote application server at the end of a build. The implementation is based on . The list of currently supported containers include:\n\n Tomcat 4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x\n JBoss 3.x/4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x\n Glassfish 2.x/3.x/4.x\n\nRefer to the \nto deploy to a running remote WebSphere Application Server. \nRefer to the \nto deploy to a running remote WebLogic Application Server.\n\n How to rollback or redeploy a previous build\n\nThere may be several ways to accomplish this, but here is one suggested\nmethod:\n\n1. Install the \n2. Create a new job that you will trigger manually only when needed\n3. Configure this job with a build parameter of type "Build selector\n for Copy Artifact", and a copy artifact build step using "Specified\n by build parameter" to select the build.\n4. Add a postbuild action to deploy the artifact that was copied from\n the other job\n\nNow when you trigger this job you can enter the build number or use any\nother available selector to select which build to redeploy. Thanks to\nHelge Taubert for this idea.\n\n Change Log\n\n Version 1.16 Nov 3, 2020\n\n Call XStream.processAnnotations \n Updated parent to latest version \n Changed to azure container instances \n\n Version 1.15 Aug 1, 2019\n\n Configure alternative context for each Tomcat container\n \n\n Version 1.14 Jul 24, 2019\n\n deployment plugin does not show any error message when the war file\n does not exist\n \n\n Nothing happens after build\n \n\n Add Deployment feature for Tomcat 9\n \n\n Tomcat deploy transfer speed\n \n\n Add support for Jenkins Pipeline\n \n\n Allow expansion of environment variables in the configuration\n \n\n Version 1.13 August 7, 2017\n\n \n\n Version 1.10 Jul 2, 2014\n\n Support deployment to multiple targets\n \n Expand variable references in the context path\n \n Added JBoss 6 and 7\n \n\n Version 1.9 Jun 11, 2012\n\n Password in config.xml is now scrambled \n This change is backwardcompatible but is not forwardcompatible\n The context path can now also be spericied\n \n\n Version 1.8 Jun 28, 2011\n\n GlassFish v3 remote deployment \n\n Version 1.7 Mar 11, 2011\n\n Fix Tomcat 7 deployement url\n\n Version 1.6 Dec 10, 2010\n\n Added Tomcat 7 and GlassFish 3 support\n Fixed bug in GlassFishAdapter, need to explicitly set the home on\n the container\n Updated library to Cargo 1.0.4\n\n Version 1.5 Jan 16, 2010\n\n Support Ant style GLOBs for specifying war/ear files\n \n\n Version 1.4 Dec 30, 2009\n\n Update library to Cargo 1.0\n Only deploy if the build was successful, unless "even when failed"\n option is checked\n Check URL format when saving config\n Update code for more recent Hudson\n Add initial glassfish support\n\n Version 1.3 Aug 5, 2008\n\n This plugin didn\'t work on slaves\n ,\n\n Version 1.2 Jul 11, 2008\n\n Fixed the problem in submitting the configuration.
