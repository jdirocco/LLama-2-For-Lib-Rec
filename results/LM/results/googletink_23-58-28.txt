<s>[INST] <<SYS>> Given the recommendations for a Java project provided in the text below, please list these recommendations exclusively in the Maven format (groupId:artifactId:version). Ensure that the output consists solely of Maven dependencies, without additional explanations or content.
    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Project Description: Tink\n\n NOTE: Tink moved to github.com/tinkcrypto and this repository will be archived\n\n As planned, we have split Tink into\n . This repository is\n going to be archived by the end of Q1 2024 March 31st, 2024.\n\n All future releases will be made from repositories in\n which are independently versioned.\n\n Please use our \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n\n Introduction\n\nUsing crypto in your application ,\nand providing simple APIs that can be used safely without needing a crypto\nbackground.\n\nTink provides secure APIs that are easy to use correctly and harder to misuse.\nIt reduces common crypto pitfalls with usercentered design, careful\nimplementation and code reviews, and extensive testing. At Google, Tink is one\nof the standard crypto libraries, and has been deployed in hundreds of products\nand systems.\n\nTo get a quick overview of Tink design please take a look at\n.\n\n, ,\n, , and\n are field tested and ready for production. The\nlatest version is ,\nreleased on 20220809.\n\nJavascript/Typescript is in an alpha state and should only be used for testing.\nPlease see the intent to remove statement\n.\n\n | \n | \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Communitydriven ports\n\nOut of the box Tink supports a wide range of languages, but it still doesn't\nsupport every language. Fortunately, some users like Tink so much that they've\nported it to their favorite languages! Below you can find notable ports.\n\nWARNING While we usually review these ports, until further notice, we do not\nmaintain them and have no plan to support them in the foreseeable future.\n\n \n\n Contact and mailing list\n\nIf you want to contribute, please read and\nsend us pull requests. You can also report bugs or file feature requests.\n\nIf you'd like to talk to the developers or get notified about major product\nupdates, you may want to subscribe to our mailing listtinkmailinglisturl.\n\n Maintainers\n\nTink is maintained by AZ:\n\n Moreno Ambrosin\n Taymon Beal\n Daniel Bleichenbacher\n William Conner\n Thai Duong\n Thomas Holenstein\n Stefan K\xc3\xb6lbl\n Charles Lee\n Cindy Lin\n Fernando Lobato Meeser\n Atul Luykx\n Rafael Misoczki\n Sophie Schmieg\n Laurent Simon\n Elizaveta Tretiakova\n J\xc3\xbcrg Wullschleger\n\nAlumni:\n\n Haris Andrianakis\n Tanuj Dhir\n Quan Nguyen\n Bartosz Przydatek\n Enzo Puig\n Veronika Sl\xc3\xadvov\xc3\xa1\n Paula Vidas\n Cathie Yun\n Federico Zalcberg\n"
