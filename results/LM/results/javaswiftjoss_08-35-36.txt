    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Project Name: javaswift/joss
    Project Description: Java OpenStack Storage JOSS \n=============================\nJOSS is a Java client for the REST interface. In order to use it you must have an account with an OpenStack Storage provider, such as the .\n\nIn order to use JOSS in your project, simply add the following dependency:\n\n\n\nYou can also download the artifact on \n\nGetting Started\n\nYour Object Store provider will have provided you with the following information in order to authenticate yourself:\n tenant ID\n tenant name\n username\n password\n authentication URL\n\nWe start by opening up a stateful client and ourselves:\n\n\n\nNote that you do not have to pass both tenant ID and tenant name; passing either tenant ID or tenant name is sufficient.\n\nOn failure, the client will throw an exception. On success, the account can now be used to execute actions on the Object Store. The account takes care of adding the token to the calls, so you don\'t have to worry about that. You should be aware, however, that tokens expire after 24 hours. The client will get a new token when it encounters a 401 and retry the original command just once.\n\nNext, we want to create a public container, where we can store our images:\n\n\n\nA container is private by default, so you will have to explicitly set it to public to be able to access it through its public URL.\n\nTo check whether the creation succeeded, list the containers.\n\n\n\nNow it is time to upload a file to the Object Store. In this example, we take an image located in the root directory of the file system.\n\n\n\nIf you fire up your browser, you can navigate to the public URL to see your resource for real. This is only possible because the container has been set to public. If it was private, you would not be able to do this.\n\nYou can also check whether the upload succeeded by listing the objects in a container or by fetching the object information.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, besides , you could also use a byte to upload a file.\n\nIt is time to download what you just uploaded. Here we go.\n\n\n\nOpen the file "/dog2.png" on the file system to verify that the operation worked. Again, also byte\n\nSpecial thanks to Oscar Westra van Holthe Kind and Erik Hooijmeijer for premium advice and support.\n\nSponsor\n\nThis component was graciously donated by \n'

    Focus on suggesting libraries that enhance the project's capabilities, improve performance, or introduce new functionalities relevant to the project's needs. Provide a brief explanation for each recommended library, highlighting how it benefits the project. Reccomend me 5 libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities.
