    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Project Description: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a fork of Essentials called EssentialsX.\n\nIf you are using this, do NOT ask Essentials for support.\n\nThe official upstream repository for the original Essentials project is at Why use EssentialsX?\n\nEssentialsX is a continuation of the Essentials plugin suite, updated to support modern Minecraft and Spigot versions.\n\nIt provides countless new features, performance enhancements and fixes that are not available in the original\nEssentials or SpigotEssentials. \n\nIf you\'re coming from the original Essentials plugin, EssentialsX is a dropin replacement for Essentials. It does,\nhowever, have some new requirements:\n\n EssentialsX requires CraftBukkit, Spigot or Paper to run. Other server software may work, but these are not tested\n by the team and we may not be able to help with any issues that occur.\n EssentialsX currently supports Minecraft versions 1.8.8, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.12.2, 1.13.2, 1.14.4, 1.15.2, \n 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.4, and 1.20.4.\n EssentialsX currently requires Java 8 or higher. We recommend using the latest Java version supported by your\n server software.\n EssentialsX requires to enable using chat prefix/suffixes and\n group support from supported permissions plugins.\n We recommend using for permissions and groups.\n If you have an unsupported permissions plugin but still want to use wildcards, enable in\n the configuration. Otherwise, the plugin will fall back to configbased permissions.\n\n\n Support\n\nNeed help with using EssentialsX? Join the to ask for help and discuss EssentialsX.\n\nIf you need to report a bug or want to suggest a new feature, you can .\n\n\n Building\n\nTo build EssentialsX, you need JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.\n\nClone this repository, then run the following command:\n\n On Linux or macOS: \n On Windows: \n\nYou can then find builds of EssentialsX modules in the directory.\n\n Running a test server\n\nYou can also run a test server from your development environment using the following command:\n\n On Linux or macOS: \n On Windows: \n\nNote the without it, you will run several servers at once, which will likely crash Gradle.\n\n\n Using EssentialsX in your plugin\n\nDo you want to integrate with EssentialsX in your plugin? You can build your plugin against the EssentialsX API,\navailable from the EssentialsX Maven repo.\n\nReleases are hosted on the Maven repo at , while snapshots including dev\nbuilds are hosted at .\n\nTo add EssentialsX to your build system, you should use the following artifacts:\n\n| Type | Group ID | Artifact ID | Version |\n|:|:|:|:|\n| Latest release | | | |\n| Snapshots | | | |\n| Older releases | | | |\n\nNote: until version , EssentialsX used the group ID. \nFrom onwards, EssentialsX uses the group ID. \nWhen updating your plugin, make sure you use the correct group ID.\n\nYou can find more information, including Maven and Gradle examples, at the\n.\n\n Support the EssentialsX project\n\nWant to help improve EssentialsX? There are several ways you can support and contribute to the project.\n\n Donate to EssentialsX\n\nDonations allow us to cover the costs of our infrastructure, and also enable us to keep updating EssentialsX with new\nfeatures and for new Minecraft versions.\n\nYou can support us with a oneoff or monthly donation via ,\nand you\'ll get a badge on GitHub for supporting the project through this.\n\nAlternatively, you can also donate monthly to the EssentialsX project on ,\nor you can make a oneoff donation on our .\n\nIf you can\'t make a donation, don\'t worry! There are lots of other ways to contribute:\n\n Contributing directly to EssentialsX\n\n Are you a developer? We\'re always happy to receive bug fixes and feature additions as pull requests.\n Do you speak multiple languages? If so, we always welcome contributions to our community translations.\n .\n\nSee to find out more.\n\n Providing support to other users\n\n Do you run a server?
