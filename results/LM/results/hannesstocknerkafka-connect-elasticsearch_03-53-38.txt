    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

This talk is for the [Paper Talk](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/public/poster_17480.html) of our paper [Towards Unsupervised Learning of Neural Architecture via Neumann's Architectural Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03627).

## Abstract

In the past decades, advancements in neural architecture search methods have led to many successes on a variety of tasks, yet the architecture discovery process still requires human designers to manually craft the models, which are time-consuming and infeasible for large-scale applications. We propose a method to automatically learn neural architectures from data using the Neumann Architectural Prior, which can be viewed as a generalization of the Bayesian posterior distribution to neural architectures. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem to learn the architecture parameters with an unsupervised learning approach. We show that our proposed approach can effectively learn the architecture parameters from data and obtain better results than previously reported methods.
