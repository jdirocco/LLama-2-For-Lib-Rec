    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Project Name: danylovolokh/VideoPlayerManager
    Project Description: VideoPlayerManager\nThis is a project designed to help controlling Android MediaPlayer class. It makes it easier to use MediaPlayer ListView and RecyclerView.\nAlso it tracks the most visible item in scrolling list. When new item in the list become the most visible, this library gives and API to track it.\n\nIt consists from two libraries:\n\n1. VideoPlayerManager it gives the ability to invoke MediaPlayer methods in a background thread. It has utilities to have only one playback when multiple media files are in the list.\nBefore new playback starts, it stops the old playback and releases all the resources.\n\n2. ListVisibilityUtils it\'s a library that tracks the most visible item in the list and notifies when it changes.\nNOTE: there should be the most visible item.\nIf there will be 3 or more items with the same visibility percent the result might be unpredictable.\nRecommendation is to have few views visible on the screen. View that are big enough so that only one view is the most visible, look at the demo below.\n\nThese two libraries combined are the tool to get a Video Playback in the scrolling list: ListView, RecyclerView.\n\n Details of implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Problems with video list\n1. We cannot use usual VideoView in the list. VideoView extends SurfaceView, and SurfaceView doesn\'t have UI synchronization buffers. All this will lead us to the situation where video that is playing is trying to catch up the list when you scroll it. Synchronization buffers are present in TextureView but there is no VideoView that is based on TextureView in Android SDK version 15. So we need a view that extends TextureView and works with Android MediaPlayer.\n\n2. Almost all methods prepare, start, stop etc... from MediaPlayer are basically calling native methods that work with hardware. Hardware can be tricky and if will do any work longer than 16ms And it sure will then we will see a lagging list. That\'s why need to call them from background thread.\n\n\n Usage\nAdd this snippet to your project build.gradle file:\n\n\n Usage of VideoPlayerManager\n\nPut multiple VideoPlayerViews into your xml file.\nIn most cases you also need a images above that will be shown when playback is stopped.\n\n\nNow you can use SingleVideoPlayerManager to playback only a single video at once:\n\n The Demo of VideoPlayerManager:\n\n\n Usage of ListVisibilityUtils\n\nThe models of your adapter need to implement ListItem\n\n\nThis messes up a bit with separating model from the logic.\nHere you need to handle the login in the model.\n\nThe ListItemsVisibilityCalculator will call according methods to:\n\n1. Get view visibility\n \n2. Set this item to active\n\n3. Deactivate the item\n\n\n The Demo of ListVisibilityUtils:\n\n\n Usage in scrolling list ListView, RecyclerView\n\nAdd this snippet to your module build.gradle file:\n\n\n\nHere is the relevant code combanation of two libraries fro implementing Video Playback in scrolling list.\n\nWhen visibility utils calls method "setActive" on your implementation of ListItem you have to call "playNewVideo".\nPlease find the working code on this Demo application.\n\n\n Demo of usage in scrolling list ListView, RecyclerView\n \n\n AndroidX support\nMigration to AndroidX gladly provided by License\n\nCopyright 2015 Danylo Volokh\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 the "License";\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n'
