<s>[INST] <<SYS>> Given the recommendations for a Java project provided in the text below, please list these recommendations exclusively in the Maven format (groupId:artifactId:version). Ensure that the output consists solely of Maven dependencies, without additional explanations or content.
    Recommendations Text: <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    As an AI specializing in software library recommendations for Java applications, provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format: groupId:artifactId:version. Here is an example of how recommendations should be formatted:
    # Example 1
    Project: 'Project A'
    Description: 'A web application for managing tasks.'
    Existing Dependencies:
    - group:artifact:version
    Recommended Libraries:
    - group:artifact:version
    - group:artifact:version


    Your tasks are to:
    - Provide recommendations exclusively in the Maven format as shown in the example.
    - Ensure recommendations are suitable for the project context described. Focus solely on suggesting libraries that could enhance the project's capabilities or performance.
    - Consider the project's context and existing dependencies to suggest libraries that complement or enhance the current setup.
    - Ignore any code dont write any code.

    Here are the top 20 libraries that are used in Java projects:
    junit:junit, org.slf4j:slf4j-api, log4j:log4j, com.google.guava:guava, commons-io:commons-io, org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12, commons-lang:commons-lang, commons-codec:commons-codec, org.mockito:mockito-core, javax.servlet:servlet-api, joda-time:joda-time, org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient, org.mockito:mockito-all, commons-logging:commons-logging, com.google.code.gson:gson, com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind, ch.qos.logback:logback-classic, org.apache.commons:commons-lang3, org.springframework:spring-context, org.springframework:spring-test
    Project Name: elaatifi/orika
    Project Description: We've recently moved to a Github Organization repo ! \n\n\n\nOrika is a Java Bean mapping framework that recursively copies among other capabilities data from one object to another. It can be very useful when developing multilayered applications.\n"
    Existing Dependencies:
    org.hibernate:hibernate-commons-annotations
- org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager
- net.sf.dozer:dozer
- org.eclipse.equinox:common

    Focus on suggesting libraries that enhance the project's capabilities, improve performance, or introduce new functionalities relevant to the project's needs. Provide a brief explanation for each recommended library, highlighting how it benefits the project. Reccomend me 17 libraries that can be added to the project to enhance its capabilities.
